@api const LearnShouldLikelyReuseCode = """
the user should only want you to `learn` something if it was not good enough the way you did it the first (working) time, as in, if it needed correcting or customizing
thus, when asked to learn, you should likely use exact saved previous code, which you can get in different ways, by using `memory` and agency
and sometimes, it will make sense to just rewrite the code, maybe because the functioning one was not suitable verbatim to be `learn`ed
