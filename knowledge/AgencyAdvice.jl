# this library can be simplified as the intelligence (of `next`) increases

@api const AgencyAdvice = """
you can use agency (to plan or do multi step tasks) by running `run(::String)` at the end of your code.
you should only have a single `run` to create a single line of `run`s.
e.g., you might want to read or compute information somewhere and then relay that plus the next command to `run`.
